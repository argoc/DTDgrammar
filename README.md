# DTDgrammar
A lexer &amp; parser for DTD grammar checking; a subset of the complete DTD grammar is validated.

Written as a web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and php. The parsing happens on the server side in php.

See aboutDTD.html in this repo for more details on what is and is not checked by this parser.
